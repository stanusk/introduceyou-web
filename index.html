          <div class="qa-content">
            <p>
              You start a conversation with our AI chatbot about why you came to
              the event, what kind of people you would like to meet, and why.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can give it as much information as you'd like without worrying
              that it's too long for anyone's attention span or not well
              formulated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chatbot might ask you follow-up questions based on the
              interests of people around you to ensure a perfect match.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as we find your perfect match, you get a notification and
              an introduction - a summary of why the two of you should meet and
              talk, what you have in common, how you can help each other, and
              what questions would help you get the conversation going.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you both accept, we'll send you a link to an in-browser video
              call to agree on a meeting point.
            </p>
            <p>
              You control the amount of meetings by enabling and disabling
              notifications (in-app toggle button).
            </p>
            <p>
              After the meeting, you pay if you want us to set up more meetings
              like this one or provide feedback on what didn't fit your needs.

          <h3>What's the story behind IntroduceYou?</h3>
          <div class="qa-content">
            <p>
              I failed my first company because I couldn't connect with the
              people I could help. Building things comes more easily to me than
              meeting new people. I passionately hate small talk and social
              signaling. But I do want to meet people. We all do. The moment I
              realized that AI could help me meet people without the anxiety, I
              started building IntroduceYou.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up before social media, I've seen how it changed us. As an
              AI enthusiast, I both love and dread where we're heading now. But
              when my son grows up, I'd love to see him spending more time
              talking to real people than to AI. IntroduceYou is an opportunity
              to build AI that will help make meeting real people as easy as
              talking to virtual ones, but with far greater benefits.
